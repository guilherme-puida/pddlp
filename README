= PDDLP =

PDDLP aims to be a simple, but fast and correct, PDDL tokenizer and parser. It
is written in pure C99 without any external dependencies, and should compile
cleanly under any POSIX-compatible system.

The entire implementation is contained in pddlp.c and pddlp.h. The other files
in this repository are just used for testing and building.

Ideally, the library should be allocation-free. This makes the parser harder to
implement and use, but it shouldn't be a big problem. If this turns out to be
infeasible, I'll try to design an API that allocates very infrequently,
preferably with a user-supplied allocator.

This project is in the initial stages of development.

== Testing ==

There is a basic test-suite implemented. To run the tests:

  make test

Running tests require that you have a recent-ish version of tcl installed.

== Limitations ==

Only the tokenizer is currently implemented, and it is case-sensitive. Because
of this case-sensitivity, some domains/problems from IPC competitions are not
tokenized correctly.

This case-sensitivity limitation is likely to disappear in the future.
