= PDDLP =

PDDLP aims to be a simple, but fast and correct, PDDL tokenizer and parser. It
is written in pure C99 without any external dependencies, and should compile
cleanly under any POSIX-compatible system.

The entire implementation is contained in pddlp.c and pddlp.h. The other files
in this repository are just used for testing and building.

The code is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License. Please see LICENSE for the
entire text.

This project is in the initial stages of development.

== Testing ==

There is a basic test-suite implemented. To run the tests:

  make test
